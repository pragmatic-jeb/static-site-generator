# Pragmatic Digital Static Site Builder
This tool is used to build simple static sites using html, scss and JS.


## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-pd-static-site using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-pd-static-site
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo pd-static-site
```

## Including Templates
```
<%= require('../components/header.html').default %>
```

The following code can be added to any html template and used to pull in a component from the components directory.
**This will not work if you try and include a component within a component as of 20th June 2022. ***

# TODO
 - add question to check if the developer wants "bleeding edge/latest packages" or "stable"
 - - Kinda risky but could run `npm run update`
 - add method of prefixing scss file with something like `main--` to tell the builder to compile a seperate stylesheet
 - - otherwise any other scss files will be ignored
 - build html sitemap in root of directory for browsing pages easily
 - - grab page titles from files to use as links  
 - Look into a method of creating seperate stylesheets if more than one root SCSS file exists
 - actually include install libs in JS/SCSS
 - huskyjs to control git commits
 - - The plan will be to run tests on commit
 - - - Test Ideas:
 - - - - validate HTML
 - - - - validate JS
 - - - - validate SCSS
 - - - - check to make sure the build directory exists. If not prompt to run `npm run build`
